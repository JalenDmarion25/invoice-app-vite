# Invoice Application

An application that allows the user to create/delete/edit invoices. I wanted to make this a full stack project with fleshed out backend, but decided to just pull the information from a github repo and store information via session storage so data doesnt persist after a session.




## TODO (Don't know if I'll get around to them...)

 - Error pages for Invoice's that no longer assist
 - More visually appealing loading screen
 - Fixed/Improve browser responsive changes
 - Improved Scrollbar
 - Small Misc. styling issues/inconsistencies
